      "question": "Why is it important for the private keys (nA and nB) to be chosen such that \(nA < n\) and \(nB < n\) in ECDH Key Exchange?",
      "options": [
        "To speed up the key exchange process.",
        "To ensure that the public keys are small and easy to compute.",
        "To prevent potential vulnerabilities and ensure security.",
